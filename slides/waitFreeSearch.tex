\begin{frame}[c]{Wait Free Search}
\textit{wait-free - every thread is able to complete its operations in a finite number of steps over an infinite period of time}
\begin{itemize}
\item two light-weight techniques to make search operations for concurrent internal BSTs, \emph{wait-free}
\item low additional overhead
\item no write instructions on share memory
\item minimizes cache traffic
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[c]{No Modification to Tree Node}
\begin{itemize}
\item as long as a key is \emph{continuously} present in the tree, its distance from root is \emph{monotonically non-increasing}
\item if a key is not found after visiting a ``certain'' number of nodes in the tree, then traversal stops
\item sufficient to examine the path traversed to check whether or not the key has moved up
\item In case the key is not continuously present in the tree, it is acceptable to return either:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item present -  linearized after the insert operation that added the key to the tree
	\item not present - linearized after the delete operation that removed the key from the tree
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Each process maintains two counters:
\begin{itemize}
\item insert counter - number of true inserts
\item delete counter - number of true deletes
\end{itemize}
$IC[i]$ and $DC[i]$ denote the number of insert and delete operations, respectively, process $P_i$ has performed so far
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{No Modification to Tree Node}
\begin{itemize}
\item insert counter incremented before adding a key
\item delete counter incremented before removing a key
\item insert (delete) counter at a process is an upper (lower) bound on the number of keys that the process has added to (removed from) the tree
\end{itemize}

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{\tiny waitFreeSearch}
read and aggregate delete counter values of all processes $DC = \sum\limits_{i=1}^p DC[i]$\;
read and aggregate insert counter values of all processes $IC = \sum\limits_{i=1}^p IC[i]$\;
$IC-DC \geq actual tree size$ as IC $\leq$ actual inserts and DC $\geq$ actual deletes\;
\end{algorithm}
$IC-DC$ gives an upper bound on number of keys to traverse before stopping the search operation

\begin{frame}[c]{With Modification to Tree Node}
\begin{itemize}
\item  previous approach - time complexity depends on tree size
\item this approach - time complexity depends on the tree height
\item but needs modifications to tree node structure
\item each node has a timestamp on when it was created 
\item timestamp - $\langle$process id,process sequence number$\rangle$
\item process sequence number is incremented before a node is added to the tree
\end{itemize}
