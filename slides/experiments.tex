\begin{frame}{Experimental Setup}
To compare the performance of various concurrent BSTs we considered the following parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item Maximum Tree Size
  \begin{itemize}
  \item key space size varied from 2\textsuperscript{13} (8Ki) to 2\textsuperscript{24} (16Mi).
  \end{itemize}
\item Relative Distribution of Operations
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Read-Dominated\phantom{1}(90\% search, \phantom{1}9\% insert and \phantom{1}1\% delete)
  \item Mixed\phantom{1234567890}(70\% search, 20\% insert and 10\% delete)
  \item Write-Dominated (\phantom{1}0\% search, 50\% insert and 50\% delete)
  \end{itemize}
\item Maximum degree of Contention
  \begin{itemize}
  \item number of threads that can concurrently operate on the tree
  \item we collected data for 32 threads
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Experimental Setup}
\small
{
\begin{itemize}
\item Throughput computed as millions of operations per second (MOPS)
\item each trial was run for 2 minutes
\item Average over 5 trials
\item \textit{pre-populated} the tree to 50\% of its maximum size to capture steady state behaviour
\item beginning of each run consisted of a 1 second ``warm-up'' phase whose numbers were excluded in the computed statistics to avoid initial caching effects
\item The machine we used is a Dell PowerEdge R820 server with 4 Intel E5-4650 @ 2.70GHz 8-core processors (32 cores in total) and 1TB of DDR3 memory with HT disabled. 256KB L2 and 20MB shared L3
\end{itemize}

Comparison of different concurrent BSTs in the absence of contention

\pause
\begin{itemize}
\item speedup is calculated over the second best algorithm
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Local recovery}
\begin{itemize}
\item helpful only for high contention cases
\item uniform distribution usually causes less contention
\item zipf distribution (a power-law distribution) causes high contention
\item experiments run on a 61 core coprocessor
\item 4 hardware threads per core - 244 total threads
