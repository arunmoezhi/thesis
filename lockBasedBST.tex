\begin{itemize}
\item combine edge-based locking with internal representation of BST
\item optimistic tree traversal

\begin{itemize}
\item common workloads have more searches than updates
\begin{itemize}
\item design is optimized for searches
\item search operations are oblivious to locks
\end{itemize}
\pause
\item Any real life workload will have more inserts than deletes
\begin{itemize}
\item insert operations do not obtain any locks
\item performs only one atomic operation
\end{itemize}
\pause
\item removal of a node in a concurrent BST is challenging
\begin{itemize}
\item delete operations uses locks
\item locks can be obtained on nodes or edges
\item locking edges instead of nodes increases concurrency
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\\Keep track of last right turn node and its key. If search terminates at a NULL node, check if the current key in the last right turn node has changed. If yes restart the operation from root.

pseudocode for delete
\begin{algorithm}[H]
locate the node to delete\;
\uIf{simple delete}
{
lock the edge $\langle$parent,node$\rangle$\;
lock the children edges\;
make the parent point to the non-null child using a simple write instruction\;
release all locks\;
}
\Else(// complex delete)
{
lock the edge $\langle$node,rightChild$\rangle$\;
find the successor\;
lock the edge $\langle$successorParent,successor$\rangle$\;
lock the children edges of successor\;
promote key\;
remove successor by a making successorParent point to non-null child of successor\;
release all locks\;
}

A scenario in which the last right turn node is removed
\input{figures/issueInSeek2}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1> \footnotesize Search(13) gets stalled at $Y$ in (a). Its last right turn node is $X$
\item<2> \footnotesize Delete(6) removes $X$ from the tree in (b). The key stored in $X$ is still 6
\item<3> \footnotesize Delete(5) results in 13 moving up the tree from $Z$ to $W$ in (c). When search(13) wakes up, it will miss 13 as the key in the last right turn node has not changed
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
\item<4> \footnotesize In the first traversal search(13) saw the node $X$
\item<4> \footnotesize In the second traversal there are two cases
\begin{itemize}
\item<4> \tiny case1, search(13) did not find $X$ - save the traversal and restart
\item<4> \tiny case2, search(13) did find $X$ - use the results of previous traversal
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
