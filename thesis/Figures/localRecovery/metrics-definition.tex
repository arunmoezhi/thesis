{\bf Metric}					& {\bf Description} 		\\ \hline

{\seekLength} 				& {number of nodes traversed in the tree by an operation}      					\\ \hline
{\estLatencyImpact}		& {a rough approximation of the amount of clock cycles devoted to each L1 cache miss (a measure of cache performance)~\cite{JefRei:2013:Book}}      					\\ \hline
