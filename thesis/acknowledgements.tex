I would like to thank my PhD advisor, Professor Neeraj Mittal for guiding me throughout my PhD journey. I'm also grateful to Dr. Rob Van Der Wijngaart who was my mentor during my internship with Intel. I enjoyed working with him on my first research project.

I'm thankful to Professor R. Chandrasekaran who has always been kind and helpful to me. I also have to thank my PhD committee, Professors Balaji Raghavachari and Venkatesan Subbarayan for their advice and suggestions in general.
